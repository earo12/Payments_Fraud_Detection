# Payments_Fraud_Detection
This is my first project with ML related with finance.
The goal of the project it's to find out whether exists a way to predict fraudulent payments by the transaction type it's done.
It was made with two kind of algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest as well.
I found an accuracy of almost 99% for each model, but it was even higher with Random Forest.
